        In your country, city or your village, there are some musicians who play
        folk music of their area. Maybe they are famous or maybe they are not!
        Let's introduce them to the world. We are not looking for folk-pop,
        folk-jazz or folk-rock. We are looking for pure folk and classical
        traditional of each region. You can send their songs here and give us
        information about their music and their works. It can be an old farmer
        or a dedicated musician. Currently its hard to find information about
        folk / traditional music of all countries in one place. We want to
        achieve this goal with your help. This project is focused on original
        folk and traditional music of the different countries, nations and
        ethnic groups of the world. Definition of “folk” and “traditional” music
        in different cultures changes, and generally it's hard to give a
        universal definition. Although folk music usually refers to orally
        transmitted music or music with unknown composers, but it can include
        the traditional classical music of countries as well which theoretically
        differs from folk music, like Indian traditional classical music vs.
        Indian folk music. But it doesn't include Western (European) Classical
        music. These music are accepted here: indigenous music, aboriginal
        music, ethnic music, regional music, rural music, root music,
        traditional ritual music, arranged folk music, recreated folk music,...
        These music are not accepted in this project: folk-pop, folk-rock,
        folk-jazz (any kind of folk fusion that employs some folk elements like
        an instrument, a melody or a rhythm in another genre or style), world
        music (folk music arranged for Western ears with commercial interests,
        usually published by Western labels; although some “world music” are
        original and accepted), fusion of different original folks (like Arabic
        oud with Indian sitar or Spanish flamenco with West African rhythms),
        modernized and contemporized versions of folk tunes with new sounds,
        especially electronic sounds.
